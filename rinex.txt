0. INTRODUCTION

This paper is a revised version of the one published by W. Gurtner and G.
Mader in the CSTG GPS Bulletin of September/October 1990. The main reason
for a revision is the new treatment of antispoofing data by the RINEX
format (see chapter 7). Chapter 4 gives a recommendation for data
compression procedures, especially useful when large amounts of data are
exchanged through computer networks. In Table A3 in the original paper the
definiton of the "PGM / RUN BY / DATE" navigation header record was
missing, although the example showed it. The redefinition of AODE/AODC to
IODE/IODC also asks for an update of the format description. For consistency
reasons we also defined a Version 2 format for the Meteorological Data files
(inclusion of a END OF HEADER record and an optional MARKER NUMBER record).

*  The slight modification (or rather the definition of a bit in the Loss  *
*  of Lock Indicator unused so far) to flag AS data is so small a change   *
*  that we decided to NOT increase the version number!                     *

In order to have all the available information about RINEX in one place we
also included parts of earlier papers and a complete set of format definiton
tables and examples.


URA Clarification (10-Dec-93):

The user range accuracy in the Navigation Message File did not contain
a definition of the units: There existed two ways of interpretation:
Either the 4 bit value from the original message or the converted value
in meters according to GPS ICD-200. In order to simplify the interpretation
for the user of the RINEX files I propose the bits to be converted into meters
prior to RINEX file creation.


1. THE PHILOSOPHY OF RINEX

The first proposal for the "Receiver Independent Exchange Format" RINEX has
been developed by the Astronomical Institute of the University of Berne for
the easy exchange of the GPS data to be collected during the large European
GPS campaign EUREF 89, which involved more than 60 GPS receivers of 4
different manufacturers. The governing aspect during the development was
the following fact:

Most geodetic processing software for GPS data use a well-defined set of
observables:

- the carrier-phase measurement at one or both carriers (actually being a
measurement on the beat frequency between the received carrier of the
satellite signal and a receiver-generated reference frequency).

- the pseudorange (code) measurement, equivalent to the difference of the
time of reception (expressed in the time frame of the receiver) and the
time of transmission (expressed in the time frame of the satellite) of a
distinct satellite signal.

- the observation time being the reading of the receiver clock at the
instant of validity of the carrier-phase and/or the code measurements.

Usually the software assumes that the observation time is valid for both
the phase AND the code measurements, AND for all satellites observed.

Consequently all these programs do not need most of the information that is
usually stored by the receivers:  They need phase, code, and time in the
above mentioned definitions, and some station-related information like
station name, antenna height, etc.


2. GENERAL FORMAT DESCRIPTION

Currently the format consists of three ASCII file types:

   1. Observation Data File
   2. Navigation Message File
   3. Meteorological Data File

Each file type consists of a header section and a data section. The header
section contains global information for the entire file and is placed at
the beginning of the file. The header section contains header labels in
columns 61-80 for each line contained in the header section. These labels
are mandatory and must appear exactly as given in these descriptions and
examples.

The format has been optimized for mimimum space requirements independent
from the number of different observation types of a specific receiver by
indicating in the header the types of observations to be stored. In
computer systems allowing variable record lengths the observation records
may then be kept as short as possible. The maximum record length is 80
bytes per record.

Each Observation file and each Meteorological Data file basically contain
the data from one site and one session. RINEX Version 2 also allows to
include observation data from more than one site subsequently occupied by
a roving receiver in rapid static or kinematic applications.

If data from more than one receiver has to be exchanged it would not be
economical to include the identical satellite messages collected by the
different receivers several times. Therefore the Navigation Message File
from one receiver may be exchanged or a composite Navigation Message File
created containing non-redundant information from several receivers in
order to make the most complete file.

The format of the data records of the RINEX Version 1 Navigation Message 
file is identical to the former NGS exchange format.

The actual format descriptions as well as examples are given in the Tables
at the end of the paper.


3. DEFINITION OF THE OBSERVABLES

GPS observables include three fundamental quantities that need to be
defined: Time, Phase, and Range.

TIME:

  The time of the measurement is the receiver time of the received signals.
  It is identical for the phase and range measurements and is identical for
  all satellites observed at that epoch. It is expressed in GPS time (not
  Universal Time).

PSEUDO-RANGE:

  The pseudo-range (PR) is the distance from the receiver antenna to the
  satellite antenna including receiver and satellite clock offsets (and
  other biases, such as atmospheric delays):

    PR  =  distance +
           c * (receiver clock offset - satellite clock offset +
                other biases)

  so that the pseudo-range reflects the actual behavior of the receiver
  and satellite clocks. The pseudo-range is stored in units of meters.

PHASE:

  The phase is the carrier-phase measured in whole cycles at both L1 and
  L2. The half-cycles measured by sqaring-type receivers must be converted
  to whole cycles and flagged by the wavelength factor in the header
  section.

  The phase changes in the same sense as the range (negative doppler). The
  phase observations between epochs must be connected by including the
  integer number of cycles. The phase observations will not contain any
  systematic drifts from intentional offsets of the reference oscillators.

The observables are not corrected for external effects like atmospheric
refraction, satellite clock offsets, etc.

If the receiver or the converter software adjusts the measurements using
the real-time-derived receiver clock offsets dT(r), the consistency of the
3 quantities phase / pseudo-range / epoch must be maintained, i.e. the
receiver clock correction should be applied to all 3 observables:

  Time(corr)  = Time(r)  -  dT(r)
  PR(corr)    =  PR(r)   -  dT(r)*c
  phase(corr) = phase(r) -  dT(r)*freq

DOPPLER:

The sign of the doppler shift as additional observable is defined as usual:
Positive for approaching satellites.


4. THE EXCHANGE OF RINEX FILES:

We recommend using the following naming convention for RINEX files:

        ssssdddf.yyt      ssss:    4-character station name designator
                           ddd:    day of the year of first record
                             f:    file sequence number within day
                                   0: file contains all the existing
                                      data of the current day
                            yy:    year
                             t:    file type:
                                   O: Observation File
                                   N: Navigation file
                                   M: Meteorological data file

To exchange RINEX files on magnetic tapes we recommend using the following
tape format:

   - Non-label; ASCII; fixed record length: 80 characters;
     block size: 8000

   - First file on tape contains list of files using above-mentioned
     naming conventions

When data transmission times or storage volumes are critical we recommend
compressing the files prior to storage or transmission using the UNIX
"compress" und "uncompress" programs. Compatible routines are available on
VAX/VMS and PC/DOS systems, as well.

Proposed naming conventions for the compressed files:

     System   Observation files   Navigation Files   Meteorological Files

     UNIX     ssssdddf.yyO.Z      ssssdddf.yyN.Z     ssssdddf.yyM.Z
     VMS      ssssdddf.yyO_Z      ssssdddf.yyN_Z     ssssdddf.yyN_Z
     DOS      ssssdddf.yyY        ssssdddf.yyX       ssssdddf.yyW  
                                  

5. RINEX VERSION 2 FEATURES

The following section contains features that have been introduced for RINEX
Version 2.

5.1 Satellite Numbers:

Version 2 has been prepared to contain GLONASS or other satellite systems'
observations. Therefore we have to be able to distinguish the satellites
of the different systems:  We precede the 2-digit satellite number with a
system denominator.

        snn                  s:    satellite system
                                   blank: system as defined in header record
                                   G    : GPS
                                   R    : GLONASS
                                   T    : Transit
                            nn:    PRN (GPS), almanac number (GLONASS)
                                   or two-digit satellite number

        Note: G, R, and T are mandatory in mixed files

5.2 Order of the Header Records:

As the record descriptors in columns 61-80 are mandatory, the programs
reading a RINEX Version 2 header are able to decode the header records with
formats according to the record descriptor, provided the records have been
first read into an internal buffer.

We therefore propose to allow free ordering of the header records, with the
following exceptions:

- The "RINEX VERSION / TYPE" record must be the first record in a file

- The default "WAVELENGTH FACT L1/2" record (if present) should precede all
  records defining wavelength factors for individual satellites

- The "# OF SATELLITES" record (if present) should be immediately followed
  by the corresponding number of "PRN / # OF OBS" records. (These records
  may be handy for documentary purposes. However, since they may only be
  created after having read the whole raw data file we define them to be
  optional.

5.3 Missing Items, Duration of the Validity of Values

Items that are not known at the file creation time can be set to zero or
blank or the respective record may be completely omitted. Consequently
items of missing header records will be set to zero or blank by the program
reading RINEX files. Each value remains valid until changed by an
additional header record.

5.4. Event Flag Records

The "number of satellites" also corresponds to the number of records of the
same epoch followed. Therefore it may be used to skip the appropriate
number of records if certain event flags are not to be evaluated in detail.

5.5 Receiver Clock Offset

A large number of users asked to optionally include a receiver-derived
clock offset into the RINEX format. In order to prevent confusion and
redundancy, the receiver clock offset (if present) should report the value
that has been used to correct the observables according to the formulae
under item 1. It would then be possible to reconstruct the original
observations if necessary. As the output format for the receiver-derived
clock offset is limited to nanoseconds the offset should be rounded to
the nearest nanosecond before it is used to correct the observables in
order to guarantee correct reconstruction.


6. ADDITIONAL HINTS AND TIPS

Programs developed to read RINEX Version 1 files have to verify the version
number. Version 2 files may look different (version number, END OF HEADER
record, receiver and antenna serial number alphanumeric) even if they do
not use any of the new features

We propose that routines to read RINEX Version 2 files automatically delete
leading blanks in any CHARACTER input field. Routines creating RINEX
Version 2 files should also left-justify all variables in the CHARACTER
fields.

DOS, and other, files may have variable record lengths, so we recommend to
first read each observation record into a 80-character blank string and
decode the data afterwards. In variable length records, empty data fields
at the end of a record may be missing, especially in the case of the
optional receiver clock offset.


7. RINEX UNDER ANTISPOOFING (AS)

Some receivers generate code delay differences between the first and second
frequency using cross-correlation techniques when AS is on and may recover
the phase observations on L2 in full cycles. Using the C/A code delay on
L1 and the observed difference it is possible to generate a code delay
observation for the second frequency.

Other receivers recover P code observations by breaking down the Y code
into P and W code.

Most of these observations may suffer from an increased noise level. In
order to enable the postprocessing programs to take special actions, such
AS-infected observations are flagged using bit number 2 of the Loss of Lock
Indicators (i.e. their current values are increased by 4).
